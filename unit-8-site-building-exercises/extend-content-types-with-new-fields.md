# Extend content types with new fields



In the next exercise, we’ll add a link field to one content type.

Below are the modules in GovCMS that provide custom content type fields. These may include validation, formatting and uploading widgets.

#### **Exercise 8.1:** Add an external link field

There are many different ways to extend content types by adding extra fields. One example is Link, which lets you enter in HTTP addresses. In this exercise we’ll add a new link field to the _Job Posting_ content type. The link will go to “More information” on another website.

1. **Add the link field**
   1. Go to Structure → Content types → Job posting and click on the Manage fields tab.
   2. Add a new field and use the following settings: ![](../.gitbook/assets/78.png)
   3. Click **Save and continue.** This will take you to the Field settings page. There are no changes so just click **Save settings**_._ This takes you to the settings for this field on the _Job posting_ content type.

**Test it**

You can also make the link title field a required field. Follow the instructions below:

* 1. Go back to the Manage Fields page of the Job Posting content type
  2. Edit the Link field
  3. Change the Allow link text to “Required”
  4. Save settings.
