1. **Content test – generated content**

Often we need content to help test new content types. However, creating content manually can be very time consuming. Instead, we can use the Devel Generate – a module, bundled in GovCMS.

**Note:** The Devel Generate module should not be enabled or used in a production website.

* 1. Navigate to Extend and search for Devel Generate. Enable the module if not enabled already. ![A screenshot of a cell phone

  2. Go to Configuration → Development → Generate content
  3. Select the Job Posting checkbox
  4. Enter 10 in the How many nodes would you like to generate? field
  5. Click **Generate** button

**Note**: Content generated by the Devel Generate module is not published by default – this is due to active content moderation workflow. Make sure you publish content if necessary.
